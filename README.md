# Team 3 CSCI 362 Project
### Authors: Logan Smith, Brielen Beamon, Scott White

This is an automated testing framework designed to verify the proper function of
the Sugar Labs source code.

Our project is centered around [Sugar Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Labs), a free and open source software project
that focuses on allowing people around the world to learn more about the world
around them. Sugar Labs is a spin off of One [Laptop Per Child](http://one.laptop.org), constituting a
simple Linux-based operating system. It is used to give disadvantaged populations
an opportunity to interact with a simple computer system.

Our goals in designing this testing framework was to verify the Sugar Labs source code functioned
correctly. To this end we designed a series of test cases to be run by calling the followig command
from within the TestAutomaiton folder:
```
./scripts/runAllTests.py
```
